## What is a BMS?

A **Situational Awareness Tool** is a tactical software platform used for command and control, situational awareness, and coordination in military, emergency response and other team operations. BMS platforms display real-time positioning, sensor data, and mission-critical information on a common operating picture.

## ATAK Integration

In the open source version of Hydris, we support integration with **ATAK (Android Team Awareness Kit)**, a widely-used tactical awareness platform.

Hydris can broadcast its situational awareness picture to ATAK, allowing teams to visualize entities, detections, and tracks from Hydris directly within their ATAK clients for Android, Windows and iPhone.

## Running Hydris with ATAK

Hydris provides two modes for ATAK integration:

### SA Mesh Mode (Broadcast)

In this mode, Hydris broadcasts the awareness picture directly to the SA Mesh network. This requires Hydris and ATAK clients to be on the same L2 network (does not work over the internet)

```bash
./hydris builtin tak
```

This mode:
- Broadcasts to the SA Mesh of ATAK
- Requires devices to be on the same network
- Automatically discovers ATAK clients via multicast

### ATAK Server Mode (TCP)

In this mode, Hydris runs a TAK server itself, that ATAK clients can connect to directly.

```bash
./hydris builtin tak --server=:8087
```

This mode:
- Starts Hydris as a TCP server on port 8087 (or your specified port)
- Allows ATAK clients to add Hydris as a TCP server
- Works across different networks and NAT boundaries

#### Adding Hydris as a TCP Server in ATAK

Once Hydris is running in server mode:

1. Open ATAK on your device
2. Navigate to Settings → Network Preferences
3. Tak Servers
4. Press the ... on top right
5. Add
6. Address: Ip address of the device running hydris
7. Advanced Options, select TCP Streaming Protocl on port 8088
6. Save and connect

ATAK will now receive real-time entity updates from Hydris and display them on the map.

## What Gets Shared

When connected to ATAK, Hydris automatically shares:

- **Entities with geospatial components** - All entities with position data appear on the ATAK map
- **Symbols** - MIL-STD-2525C symbols are translated to ATAK's symbol format
- **Tracks** - Fused tracks from multiple sensors
- **Detections** - Raw sensor detections with bearing information
- **Metadata** - Entity labels, classifications, and timestamps

The ATAK integration respects Hydris's Entity Component System - only entities with `geo` components are visualized, while other entities remain in the awareness picture for programmatic access.
